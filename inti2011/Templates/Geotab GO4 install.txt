"Creation comes out of imperfection."

There's an old proverb in the video encoding world: "Speed, size, quality: pick two." It means that you always have to make a trade-off between the time it takes to encode a video, the amount of compression used, and the picture quality. Well, this release of HandBrake refuses to compromise. It picks all three.
Use this to convert video to x264

 To use Firefogg on your site, you have to use the Firefogg Javascript api. There are two modes you can integrate Firefogg. one uploads data while the video is encoded. The other encodes the video and starts a regular multipart HTTP POST after that.

    * Example encoding and uploading at the same time
    * Example sending a multipart POST request once encoding is done
