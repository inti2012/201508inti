    We help you analyze: </h3>
<p><strong><u>Fuel</u></strong>             Our focus is  not simply to reduce the miles you drive with optimized miles driven in   terms of  productivity, efficiency, and safety.  We focus on enabling you to  understand why you drive such that any mileage reduction initiatives can   be  managed including reducing the miles per customer visit. In real-time we   change  the speeding and idling habits that will reduce fuel expense.   </p>
<p><strong><u>Accidents</u></strong>     The total  cost of accidents can exceed the physical damage repair cost by a factor   of 16.  We focus on identifying risky driving behavior, providing real-time   feedback to  the driver to eliminate the poor driving, provide supervisors with the  necessary information to expedient coaching for sustaining safe driving   in the  fleet. We can help you identify after hour use. In-vehicle habits that   we can  manage include speeding, idling, seatbelt use, over-RPM and harsh   braking.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Mileage </u></strong>        Ensuring that employees manage the miles they drive to ensure that the   lease  mileage ceiling is met will best manage your fleet lease cost. (No   surprise at  end of lease). </p>
<p><strong><u>Maintenance</u></strong>         We have engine diagnostics. The  lifecycle cost per mile factor takes into account tires, brakes, oil   changes,  asset repairs and depreciation. </p>
<p>Look forward to working with you!</p>
